Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the start of the meeting, on the effort to achieve an outline for the release of our hostages [translated from Hebrew]: \"We are making every effort. The more public this effort is, the more distant it is. The more discreet it is, the greater are its chances for success. Naturally, and for these reasons, I am prevented from sharing with you. I would like you to understand that we are truly committed, in every sense of the word; this is not just lip service. This is a genuine effort. It is not fictitious; neither is it just for show. It stems from our commitment to return them all. The idea is everyone; the effort is for everyone. While it is too early to say how it will happen, the effort is being made at this time, at this very moment.\" Twenty-six representatives from 18 families participated in this meeting. The Prime Minister was accompanied by Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi, his Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil and Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs.\u00a0",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Wednesday, 31 January 2024), at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with a delegation of ambassadors to the UN, led by Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan, from Malta, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Slovenia and Sierra Leone. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \"Welcome. It's good to see all of you, and I'm glad you came to see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears direct evidence of the slaughter and the savagery.\u00a0 The UN has not been a stellar organization when it comes to dealing with Israel. It's often unbelievably tilted. It has the UN Human Rights Commission, so-called Human Rights Commission, that devotes an enormous part of its resolutions against Israel, and nothing against Iran or Yemen or other arenas of savagery and aggression.\u00a0Not by saying it should be a plague on both your houses. No, because Israel is fighting the war of civilization against barbarism, because Israel is responding to unbelievably brutal and unprovoked attacks and because it's doing so with the greatest effort that I see of any army to minimize civilian casualties against an enemy that is committing a double war crime of both targeting our civilians, mutilating our civilians, raping our women and men, beheading them after the rape, burning babies alive, and sundry other atrocities that the only time that we've seen anything like that directed against the Jewish people was in the Holocaust.\u00a0 South Africa had the temerity to bring this to the ICJ, charging us with genocide against, really in the service of a genocidal organization. Now, the worst thing that I can say is this, that many of the charges, false and unfounded, that were leveled against us in The Hague were brought by UNRWA officials. And we have discovered in the last few weeks that UNRWA officials were complicit in the massacre. I think it's time that the international community and the UN itself understand that UNRWA's mission has to end. UNRWA is self-perpetuating. It is self-perpetuating also in its desire to keep alive the Palestinian refugee issue. And we need to get other UN agencies and other aid agencies replacing UNRWA if we're going to solve the problem of Gaza as we intend to do. There are other agencies in the UN. There are other agencies in the world. They have to replace UNRWA. UNRWA is totally infiltrated with Hamas. It has been in the service of Hamas and its schools, and in many other things. I say this with great regret because we hoped that there would be an objective and constructive body to offer aid. We need such a body today in Gaza. But UNRWA is not that body. It has to be replaced by some organization or organizations that will do that job.\" Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said that every country that continues to fund UNRWA before a comprehensive investigation of the organization needs to know that its funds will serve terrorism and that the assistance that will be transferred to UNRWA is liable to reach Hamas terrorists instead of the population in Gaza. He called on all donor countries to freeze their support and demand an in-depth investigation that will cover all UNRWA employees. Also attending the meeting were the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tzachi Braverman, the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser, Dr. Ophir Falk and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan.\u00a0",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Tuesday, 30 January 2024), visited the Bnei David Institutions in Eli, 15 graduates of which have fallen during the war. The Prime Minister visited the memorial room where he met with fellow bereaved Israelis Eitan Moreno \u2013 the brother of Itay, Livnat Silverman \u2013 the sister of Uriel, Asaf Ben Hamo \u2013 the brother of Michael, and Yonatan Silverman \u2013 the brother of Ariel, as well as with the yeshiva rabbis, led by Rabbi Eli Sadan. Prime Minister Netanyahu met with the students of the yeshiva and the IDF preparatory program in the study hall, where he recited the prayer for the IDF soldiers' well-being, after which Rabbi Yoel Rechel recited the prayer for the welfare of the state. Prime Minister Netanyahu to the Bnei David students [translated from Hebrew]: \"Thank you Rabbi Sadan, you are a great leader of the people of Israel, and this exemplary yeshiva is to the glory of the people, heritage and fighters of Israel. We are in the midst of a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness. The sons of darkness, the monsters of Hamas and their partners in Hezbollah, and others, thought and said that we were weak, vulnerable, and as a spider's web \u2013 that is how they defined us. They have discovered sacrifice, heroism and great intensity, which reflects the heroism of Israel throughout our generations. This generation is not diminishing; this generation is growing. Not only is it growing, it is storming forward with courage and an unparalleled strength of spirit. This is what is happening, with your friends, with anyone who leaves this place and with many others among the people of Israel. But this entails a heavy price, the price of the tribulations with which the Land of Israel is acquired, the loss of our best sons and fighters, many from this very study hall, which is already bereft of amazing fighters like Roi Klein, Eliraz Perez, Emmanuel Moreno and others. We were just in the memorial room, their pictures were on the wall but the pictures are in the heart. The heavy price is not just the loss of these splendid sons, it is also the suffering of the families. I know the price of bereavement, it is too heavy to bear, but the families bear it with pride. What I would like to say to the families, to you and to all citizens of Israel: The testament of the fallen is our mission. It is possible to summarize this mission in two words: Total victory. This is not 'another round', neither is it an exchange of blows, nor is it an operation \u2013 it is total victory. Nothing less. I am committed to it. Our fighters are committed to it and the overwhelming majority of the people is committed to it. We will not compromise on anything less than total victory.\u00a0I hear talk about all kinds of deals. I would like to make it clear: We will not conclude this war without achieving all of its goals. This means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.\u00a0We will not withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Total victory. This victory, as it is written, will be achieved 'Not by might and not by power but by My spirit says the Lord of Hosts.' [Zechariah 4:6]. By spirit; it will be achieved by spirit. Bialik bid us to go to the study hall. He knew this well. He was in the study hall of the Volozhin Yeshiva, the mother of Lithuanian yeshivas, that my grandfather, Rabbi Natan Milikovsky-Netanyahu studied in, and where Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook studied. A deep friendship sprung up between them. But Volozhin, with all that it contributed to the world of Torah, was in the Diaspora. And here in Eli, this study hall is planted in the soil of the motherland, where our ancestors walked, fought, planted, dreamed and built. Here \u2013 in this place. From here stems the well of generations. Here burns the flame, the flame of the promise of the eternity of Israel in the Land of Israel. This the great and noble mission. It is your mission, the mission of the fallen and it is our mission. I salute the fallen. I salute you and tell you \u2013 together we will fight and with\u00a0G-d's help, together we will win.\" Prime Minister Netanyahu was accompanied by his Chief-of-Staff Tzachi Braverman, Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs and Mateh Binyamin Regional Council Head Yisrael Gantz.\u00a0",

Ms. Patten started her series of meetings in Israel at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem and met with the Political Director of the MFA, Ms. Aliza Ben Nun.

During her visit, Ms. Patten will meet with survivors, witnesses, treatment professionals, and representatives of the police and other security forces in order to collect evidence of the sexual violence that Hamas committed against women and men during the 7 October attack. In the course of the coming week, Patten and her delegation are expected to meet with governmental and civil society representatives, as well as to tour southern Israel, accompanied by a team of experts. Ms. Patten is expected to present the findings of her visit to the Secretary-General of the UN for inclusion of the events of 7 October as part of the UN's annual report on sexual violence.\u00a0",

        "content": "(Communicated by the President's Spokesperson) \u00a0\u00a0President Isaac Herzog this evening (Sunday, 28 January 2024), spoke in reference to the ruling of the International Court of Justice on Friday. In particular he noted the Court\u2019s inclusion of quotes made by the President.\u00a0He spoke during an event of the 929 Bible Study Initiative held at the President\u2019s Residence this evening, held in memory of and with the participation of families of, some of the fallen soldiers from the fight against Hamas in Gaza.\u00a0President Herzog said, \"I cannot help but relate to the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, last Friday. We are fighting an exceptionally just campaign. A campaign for the return of the hostages, those who are held and tortured by Hamas murderers in an unparalleled crime against humanity. We are fighting a campaign to restore security to our citizens, women and men, elderly and babies. A whole people which Hamas didn't just declare their desire to wipe from face of the earth, but actually set out on a brutal massacre to destroy \u2013 and is still working hard to do so. Israel has the full right to self-defense, and it will continue to be committed to the security of its citizens. Unequivocally. This is a right anchored in the most essential foundations of international law, and in general, everyone with sense can see that Israel is acting in accordance with international law.\u00a0The very fact that the hearing at the court in The Hague was held on the eve of International Holocaust Memorial Day, to judge whether the democratic, moral, and responsible State of Israel, which rose from the ashes of the Holocaust with the overwhelming support of the family of nations and its institutions was guilty of committing genocide, is a blood libel that undermines the very values on which this court was established.\u00a0There is something shocking about seeing how the 'post-truth' phenomenon permeates even the most important institutions. Even on a personal level, I was disgusted by the way they twisted my words, using very, very partial and fragmented quotes, with the intention of supporting an unfounded legal contention.\u00a0I was here - in this very hall - a few days after the terrible massacre, when I was asked by the world\u2019s media about the situation in Gaza, I replied that the widespread civilian support in Gaza for the crimes and atrocities of October 7 could not be ignored, and that Hamas operates from the heart of the civilian population everywhere, from children's bedrooms in homes, from schools, from mosques, and hospitals.\u00a0But I added and emphasized, that for the State of Israel - and of course for me personally \u2013 innocent civilians are not considered targets in any way whatsoever.\u00a0To be clear: The State of Israel sees great importance in the humanitarian aspect of the campaign. Israel is committed to this, and operates, as it has always operated and will operate, in accordance with international law.\u00a0There are also innocent Palestinians in Gaza. I am deeply sorry for the tragedy they are going through. From the first day of the war right until today, I call and am working for humanitarian aid for them, and only for them. This is part of our values as a country.\u00a0But the reality cannot be ignored, a reality which we all saw with our own eyes as published by Hamas on that cursed day: and that was the involvement of many residents of Gaza in the slaughter, in the looting, and in the riots of October 7. How the crowds in Gaza cheered at the sight of Israelis being slaughtered and their bodies mutilated. At the sight of hostages - God knows what they did to them - wounded and bleeding being dragged through the streets. In view of such terrible crimes, it is appropriate that the honorable court investigates them in depth, and not casually in passing.\u00a0The world must not forget even for a moment: Hamas is responsible for a terrible crimes against humanity - the massacre of October 7, and the taking of hostages still held in captivity.\u00a0Hamas is also responsible for the suffering of their own people. Often quite directly -when they threaten their lives, forcefully taking humanitarian aid facilitate by Israel, and using them as a human shield.\u00a0The justness of our remains resolute.\u00a0I want to offer strength, and from here pay tribute, to the professional, experienced, and determined team, who represented us in this important ruling, and of course thank Judge Aharon Barak.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening (Saturday, 27 January 2024), at the Kirya in Tel Aviv [translated from Hebrew]: \"'Our crushing victory is more important than anything. Continue at full force so that our victory will be even more crushing' These were the final words written by heroic fighter Elkanah Wiesel. Elkanah, a reservist, was the father of four children. He fell heroically this week in the battles in Gaza, defending our country. In this difficult week in which we lost heroic fighters, I reiterate before you, citizens of Israel, our commitment to fully implementing their testament and achieving all goals of the war: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel. We will never forget the atrocities of October 7. We will never forget the massacre, the rapes, the murders and the mutilations. We will never forget the abductions. As of today, we have returned 110 of our hostages and we are committed to returning all of them home. We are dealing with this and we are doing so around the clock including now. We will never forgive what the Hamas monsters did to our daughters and our sons; therefore, there is no alternative to total victory. We must win \u2013 and we will win. Citizens of Israel, Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. There is no greater absurdity than what occurred yesterday, on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. There were those who came to The Hague to \u2013 falsely and outrageously \u2013 accuse us of genocide. On whose behalf did they come? On behalf of Hamas, the 'new Nazis', who came to perpetrate genocide against us. I hold here Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf' in Arabic. Our fighters found this book in civilians' homes in the Gaza Strip. They found extensive antisemitic and Nazi literature there. This is what they educate their children on. Therefore, I insist that after we eliminate Hamas, what is called 'the day after', in Gaza there will be no element that educates its children, not only for terrorism but also for the destruction of Israel, for the destruction of the entire Jewish people. It was on behalf of 'the new Nazis' that South Africa came to The Hague. I must tell you, the very willingness in The Hague to discuss this ridiculous claim, the very fact that it was not rejected outright, proves that many in the world have not learned anything from the Holocaust. But we have learned from it. The main lesson of the Holocaust is that only we will defend ourselves by ourselves. Nobody will do this for us. Therefore, despite the great pain that is burning our hearts, we must continue to be strong and determined and we must return fire against those who seek our destruction. The state of the Jews arose from the ashes of the Holocaust in order to promise a defensive shield for the Jewish people. Israel, like every sovereign country, has the basic right to defend itself. Nobody will take this right from us and nobody will stop us from implementing it. We are fighting a war, the justice of which is unparalleled, with an army, the morality of which is unparalleled. This war was forced on us by an abhorrent enemy, that openly declares its intention to murder all the Jews. On October 7, they murdered, beheaded, raped, and burned infants. If they could have, they would have massacred all of us. If we do not eliminate the Hamas terrorists, these 'new Nazis', the next massacre is only a matter of time. Therefore, we are determined to finish the task, to eliminate Hamas. And if it takes time, we will not relent in the mission. And those who, first and foremost, cling to the mission, are our heroic fighters and brave commanders. This week our fighters completed the encirclement of Khan Yunis. They also eliminated hundreds of terrorists, and destroyed terrorist infrastructure above and below ground. They are fighting with utmost bravery to ensure our lives in our land. In order to ensure our future for generations, I have directed the Defense Minister and the Finance Minister to submit to the Government an unprecedented plan, a huge plan, to strengthen our security industries for decades ahead. We will do so with immense investments in order to ensure our security independence and freedom of action. The nation believes in our fighters, our spirit and our resilience. We are all proud of them and we all embrace them. But I want to say: Unfortunately, there are those among us who choose to cast doubt on our determination and our ability to win. The voices of the weak, among them all kinds of 'former this or that', are trying to sew doubt, despondency and pessimism. Then I want to tell you, citizens of Israel \u2013 these voices are a small minority. They are mistaken and are misleading others. We will win a total victory, and our commitment to win a total victory is the first and most important guarantee of achieving it. We have no other choice apart from total victory. We will win because we have a strong people and daring fighters who are sacrificing our lives to defend the eternity of Israel. Fighters like Elkanah Wiesel, whose testament I opened with, and with whose testament I will conclude: 'I was already wounded in Operation Protective Edge,' he writes, 'I had the choice of staying behind, but not for a moment do I regret returning to be a fighter. On the contrary, this was the most important choice I ever made.' Happy is the people that has such sons and daughters; happy is the people that has such fighters and commanders. Together we will fight, and with G-d's help, together we will win.\"\u00a0",

Like every country, Israel has an inherent and inalienable right to defend itself against the terrorist onslaught it still faces. The vile attempt by South Africa to deny Israel this fundamental right was justly rejected.\u00a0The Court has repeatedly made clear that its decision today does not determine whether South Africa\u2019s claims have any merit, or the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this matter.\u00a0Israel remains committed, as it has repeatedly affirmed and demonstrated, to acting in accordance with its rights and obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.

Israel will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and to do its utmost according to the law to keep civilians out of harm\u2019s way, even as Hamas uses them as human shields.\u00a0South Africa\u2019s baseless accusations, and its attempt to empty the word genocide of its unique force and special meaning, have been widely denounced by numerous States known for their commitment to the rule of law. Israel is confident that the Court will likewise reject these unfounded claims at the merits phase of proceedings.\u00a0On the eve of January 27th, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Israel calls on all those genuinely committed to the solemn promise of \u201cnever again\u201d enshrined in the Genocide Convention, to reject the unconscionable efforts to distort the truth in support of a genocidal terrorist organization. Hamas, and its sponsor in Tehran, seek to deny both Israelis and Palestinians the ability to achieve a peaceful future. South Africa should be denounced for being their willing accomplice. \u00a0\u00a0Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz:\u201cIsrael\u2019s commitment to international law is unwavering. It exists independently of any ICJ proceedings, as does Israel\u2019s inherent right to defend itself against the genocidal terrorists of Hamas. I reiterate this today on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.I commend our excellent legal team for their outstanding efforts.

More than sixty-five ambassadors attended the symposium where they heard a lecture by Yad Vashem's Echoes and Reflections Project Director Ms. Sheryl Ochayon entitled, \u201cThe Through Lines of Antisemitism, From Its Roots to the Current Day\u201d, relating to the theme of the day; \"Antisemitism: The Fate of the Jewish People?\u201d\u00a0 \"Each year on Passover, Jews worldwide ask, 'Why is this night different from all other nights?',\" Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan told the ambassadors that attended. \"This year's International Holocaust Remembrance Day, in the wake of the attack by Hamas on October 7th, we ask why is this Holocaust Remembrance Day unlike any other. The Holocaust's does not define Jews but its impact on the Jewish psyche is profound. The echoes of October 7th remind us that 'Never Again' is a commandment we must fulfill and not just an empty clich\u00e9. As we approach the 80th anniversary of liberation in 2025, Holocaust remembrance and education remain essential to creating a more just society.\"\u00a0 In the week, proceeding the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan visited Brussels where he met with heads of the European Union including President of the European Commission H.E. Ursula von der Leyen, European Union Vice President H.E. Margaritis Schinas and President of the European Parliament H.E. Roberta Metsola for a series of meetings discussing the importance of Holocaust remembrance. In the meeting with Von der Leyen Dayan expressed his grave concerns for the exponential rise in antisemitism worldwide and the need for actions. \"Antisemitism is not just an issue for the Jewish people alone. It must be on top of the global agenda, for if left unchecked it will eventually affect Europe and the world in general and therefore requires immediate and decisive action,\" Dayan told the leaders.\u00a0 While in Brussels Yad Vashem Chairman Dayan participated in an EU Working Group meeting addressing the implantation of the EU Strategy on Combating Antisemitism and fostering Jewish life in Europe. Dayan also attended an event headed by the Deputy Secretary General of NATO Mircea Geoan\u0103. Before traveling to Brussels, Dayan participated in a conference organized by the EJA (European Jewish Association) in cooperation with Yad Vashem, in Krakow together with various past and present world leaders addressing the importance of commemorating the Holocaust and continuing the battle against antisemitism. New Art Exhibition: \u201cBigger than Me\u201d by Israeli Artist Shai Azoulay Yad Vashem also debuted a new art exhibition titled \u201cBigger Than Me\u201d featuring six oil paintings and additional sketches created by renowned artist Shai Azoulay over the last month and a half. The exhibition will be on display in Yad Vashem\u2019s Museum of Holocaust Art on the Mount of Remembrance through Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day observed this year 5-6 May 2024.\u00a0 This is the first time Yad Vashem has exhibited artwork that was not created by Holocaust victims or survivors and does not consist of art that depict the atrocities of the Holocaust. During his time at Yad Vashem, Azoulay toured the Mount of Remembrance campus and explored its monuments and collections, including those dedicated to art, artifacts, photographs and documents. In wake of this journey of discovery, he created the body of artwork currently on display in this exhibition. The exhibition is part of a new cultural Residency Program at Yad Vashem. \u00a0 Online\u00a0Yad Vashem has uploaded a mini-site marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, featuring a variety of resources for the public to view, share and engage in, including online exhibitions, educational resources and the \"IRemember Wall.\" This annual social media campaign is a unique and meaningful opportunity for the public to participate in a commemorative activity to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. By joining the IRemember Wall, the participant's Facebook profile is randomly linked to the name of a Holocaust victim from Yad Vashem's Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names. Over the years hundreds of thousands of individuals participated in this commemorative event.\u2003\u00a0",

        "content": "(Communicated by the President's Spokesperson) \u00a0\u00a0President Isaac Herzog today (Wednesday, January 24, 2024) hosted a special event ahead of International Holocaust Memorial Day, at the President\u2019s Residence in Jerusalem.\u00a0\u00a0The event, held in partnership with International March of the Living, brought together survivors of the Holocaust including those who were saved as part of the Kindertransport operation, which was launched 85 years ago following the Kristallnacht Pogrom of 1938.\u00a0The event, which had been scheduled to take place to mark the anniversary of Kristallnacht in November but was postponed following the Hamas attack of October 7, was held with the participation of ten Kindertransport survivors. \u00a0\u00a0At the conclusion of the event, which was also attended by Germany's Ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, Present Herzog introduced the Foreign Minister of Holland Hanke Bruins Slot to some of the Kindertransport survivors, who spoke of their journey which took them through Holland on the way to the United Kingdom.\u00a0\u00a0One of the survivors attending with her family, Mirjam Szpiro, was rescued from Nazi Germany in the Kindertransport operation in 1938. In recent weeks, she was once again evacuated from her home \u2013 this time in Kibbutz Zikim on the Gaza border, after the community came under attack by Hamas attack on October 7. \u00a0\u00a0Mirjam said at the event: \u201cWe had been told we had to evacuate and suddenly I had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I was standing there, an 88-year-old woman outside her home, and I suddenly remembered the three-year-old girl I was. I didn\u2019t remember these things before, the emotions, but suddenly I was back there. And this is the second time I leave my house.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She added, \u201cI hope we can return soon. The house was not damaged, and even the tree I planted in the yard two weeks before the war survived.\u201d Mirjam has since been housed in a hotel with other displaced Israelis from her community.\u00a0\u00a0The Holocaust survivors, the children of the Kindertransport who participated in the event, were deeply moved by the welcome by the President and First Lady, and expressed their appreciation to them and the International March of the Living for helping tell their story, and promoting awareness and understanding of the lessons of the past. The survivors who participated in the event are Mirjam Szpiro, Aliza Tenenbaum, Tova Gorfine, Henry Foner, Walter Bingham, Prof. Daniel Reis, Paul Alexander, Frieda Schalkowski, George Shefi, the son of the deceased Ruth Davis, Barry Davis.\u00a0\u00a0Kristallnacht, or the November Pogrom, that took place on November 9, 1938, is considered as the culmination of growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Nazi Germany. It was a decisive moment in the understanding that the lives of the Jews were no longer safe in Europe. Following the pogrom, the Kindertransport Operation to save Jewish children from Germany, Austria and the occupied territories was launched, and thanks to the organization of the Jewish community in Great Britain, 10,000 children left by train from Germany to the Netherlands and from there to England during the period from December 1938 until the outbreak of World War II. The children were sent to safety alone, without their parents, many of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.\u00a0\u00a0As part of the organization\u2019s work to educate and commemorate the Holocaust, in October, International March of the Living travelled with three survivors of the Kindertransport Operation to retrace their journey to safety. They travelled by train from Germany to the Netherlands, and from there to Britain by boat. Once they arrived in the UK at Harwich, they travelled to London by train, arriving in Liverpool station. They were welcomed in Hyde Park by Britain\u2019s Chief Rabbi Mirvis and Jewish children from the Immanuel College School for a special memorial ceremony. \u00a0\u00a0The journey \u2013 which took place in the immediate aftermath of the atrocities of October 7 \u2013 was filmed for a special documentary which was also screened during the event at the President\u2019s Residence. The film was produced by International March of the Living, with the support of the Moskowitz family - in memory of \u00a0Holocaust survivor Henry Moskowitz Z\u201dL and in honor of his wife Rose Moskowitz, and in collaboration with the Ghetto Fighters\u2019 House Museum, and with the support of ELAL and Leonardo Hotels.\u00a0\u00a0The survivors who made the journey were: Walter Bingham (100), George Shefi (92), and Paul Alexander (88). \u201cThe news and the horrific sights from Israel accompanied us all throughout the journey. We never dreamed that in our lifetime we would see such a terrible pogrom against Jews and more in the Land of Israel\u201d said the three.\u00a0\u00a0President Isaac Herzog: \u201cThis is a truly moving event. It is moving to see survivors after 85 years, to hear the personal stories of each and every one of you, and the Zionist story of each and every one of you, but it is especially moving because of the period in which we find ourselves. International Holocaust Memorial Day is not only about remembering the past, it is about our shared responsibility to the present and the future. We have with us survivors of the Holocaust, those who were forced from their homes and taken away from the families because of the Nazis \u2013 and to our great sorrow, were witness to the horrors of October 7, and were once again, displaced from their homes. This is day, is about educating the whole world about the dangers of hatred and antisemitism in particular. We have seen where this can lead \u2013 and on October 7, we got a terrible and painful reminder.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The President added, \u201cThe generation of the Holocaust, those who saw with their own eyes the horrors of Nazism, we owe you a debt of gratitude for your resilience and hope. We are here to say clearly, to you, dear children of the Kindertransport, we will never forget your heroism. We will never forget your bravery and resilience, and how you rebuilt your lives, and helped build the State of Israel. May the memory of the six million of our sisters and brothers be eternally etched on all our hearts.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Shmuel Rosenman, Chairman of the International March of the Living: \u201cWe set out to document this journey which came into being because of the worst anti-Jewish pogrom that the Jews of Europe had known in the years leading to the Holocaust, Kristallnacht. And as we embarked, it was in the hours after the terrible pogrom of October 7 which took place in Israel. Shocked by the stories of the survivors about what they experienced 85 years ago, and horrified by the abhorrent stories from Israel, we were reminded that the hatred of the Jews has no expiration date. It changes its form. But its motivation is the same \u2013 the annihilation of the Jewish people\". \u00a0\u00a0Mark Moskowitz, a member of the International March of the Living board: \u201cThe Moskowitz family is honored to take part in bringing this critically important project to life \u2014 documenting the testimonies of three Kindertransport survivors as they retrace their journeys from oppression to freedom. \u00a0In the wake of October 7th and the subsequent unleashing of rabid worldwide antisemitism, the work of March of the Living in teaching the lessons of the Holocaust by facilitating Survivors to guide younger generations through their experiences, is more important than ever. \u00a0 The dedication in honor of Henry and Rose Moskowitz is particularly fitting; much like the survivors featured in this documentary, \u00a0they were able to find hope amidst moments of immense despair in the Shoah and after the war, see a future of optimism and rebuilding for the Jewish people.\u201d\u00a0",

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]: \"Yesterday was one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war. We lost 24 of our best heroic sons who fell in defense of the homeland. Together with the citizens of Israel, I grieve for each one of them. I embrace the families, whose lives have changed forever. From here we send from here prayers for the well-being of our wounded. The IDF is carrying out a thorough inquiry into the tragedy; we must learn the lessons and do everything for the well-being of our soldiers. We are in the midst of a war, the justification of which is without parallel. In this war there have been great achievements, including today, in completing the encirclement of Khan Yunis, but there have also been very heavy costs. While we bow our heads in memory of our fallen, we are not relenting \u2013 even for a moment \u2013 in striving for the goal that has no alternative \u2013 achieving total victory. Together we will fight \u2013 and together we will win.\" Remarks by\u00a0Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u00a0[translated from Hebrew]: \"The difficult news we received yesterday, about the death of 24 of our soldiers, some of our finest men, from all around the country, north and south, from everywhere, is a heavy blow. We wish to express our deepest sorrow and condolences for the mourning families. We continue at this time with the spirit of the fallen - to complete our missions and do everything necessary. Our forces operate deep in the enemy's [Hamas] territory, in Khan Yunis, soldiers from the Paratroopers, the 7th Armored Brigade, from Givati, [operate] in the entire southern region. We are keeping an eye on everything that is happening in the north. Hezbollah continues to provoke us, I have now conducted a special situation assessment on this matter. We are prepared, we do not want war, but we are ready for any situation that may develop in the north. Therefore, we have one hand reaching to the south and a watchful eye towards the north. And once again, I send an embrace from the bottom of my heart to the members of the bereaved families and express deep sorrow for our fallen soldiers.\" (Defense Minister Gallant's remarks are courtesy of his Media and Foreign Affairs Advisor, Betty Ilovici.) Remarks by Minister Gantz [translated from Hebrew]: \"On behalf of the entire people of Israel, I would like to convey our condolences, the condolences of every segment of society, to the families that have lost what was more dear to them than anything, throughout the campaign, in every situation, and \u2013 of course \u2013 in the last, painful, 24 hours. These were reservists who left everything and turned out to defend the State of Israel and the Zionist vision, no less. Thus we remember all those who have fallen; thus we will remember those who perished in the severe tragedy yesterday. Barry Sakharov sings: 'A broken heart is a whole heart.' This morning all of our hearts are broken before the fallen and their families. We are all wholehearted in the important mission for which they fell and left for us to realize and ensure the peace of the State of Israel, the peace of our children and our future in this region. We will do this together; we will do this united. I would like to stand by the bereaved families. We need to continue. I have no doubt that when they went out yesterday on their mission, they intended for us to continue, and this is what we will do.\"",

We are not giving immunity to any terrorist: Not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, not in Syria and not anywhere. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him. Regarding our hostages, we have returned home \u2013 as of today \u2013 110 of our hostages and we are obligated to returning all of them. This is one of the goals of the war and the military pressure is a necessary condition to achieving it. I am working on this around the clock. But let it be clear: I utterly reject the Hamas monsters' capitulation terms. Hamas is demanding, in exchange for the release of our hostages, the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the murders and rapists of the Nukhba and leaving Hamas in place. Were we to agree to this \u2013 our soldiers would have fallen in vain. Were we to agree to this \u2013 we would not be able to ensure the security of our citizens. We would be unable to safely restore the evacuees to their homes and the next October 7 would be only a question of time. I am not prepared to accept such a mortal blow to the security of Israel; therefore, we will not agree to this. The conditions being proposed by Hamas underscore a simple point \u2013 there is no substitute for victory. Only total victory will ensure the elimination of Hamas and the return of all our hostages. I told President Biden this in our conversation over the weekend. I greatly appreciate the US support for Israel and I also expressed this to the President. However, I will strongly insist on our vital interests. I emphasized to President Biden our determination to achieve all of the goals of the war, and to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel. Therefore, I insist that after we achieve total victory, after we eliminate Hamas, there will be no entity in Gaza that finances terrorism, educates for terrorism or sends terrorists. Gaza must be demilitarized, under Israel's full security control. I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River. As Prime Minister of Israel, I have strongly upheld this position in the face of great international and domestic pressure. My insistence is what has prevented \u2013 over the years \u2013 the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel. As long as I am Prime Minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this. If someone has a different position, they should show leadership and candidly state their position to the citizens of Israel.\"\u00a0",

The European Parliament also criticized Hamas' misuse of civilian infrastructure, the construction of attack tunnels and the use of human shields. In the resolution, the European Parliament expressed shock at the enormous wealth of Hamas leaders at the expense of the Palestinian citizens who live in poverty, and condemned countries that provided financial, material and operational aid to Hamas and called for an investigation to determine the sources of funding and weapon systems of the terrorist organization.

        "content": "(Communicated by the IAA Spokesperson) Rare evidence for the earliest use of coins in the country\u2014an extremelyed to the Persian period (6th\u20135th centuries BCE)\u2014was recently discovered in an Israel Antiquities Authority excavation at a site in the Judean Hills. The excavation, carried out in the course of infrastructure works undertaken by the Netivei Israel National Transport Infrastructure Company, also exposed a building from the First Temple Period, with even earlier evidence for commerce in the form of a sheqel weight. The rare coin was discovered by Semyon Gendler, the Acting Judean District Archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The coin, found intentionally broken, was minted with a square stamp embedded into one face; later, more sophisticated techniques produced coins with protruding rather than sunken stamps. According to Dr. Robert Kool, Head of the Israel Antiquities Authority Numismatic Department, \u201cThe coin is extremely rare, joining only half a dozen coins of its type that have been found in archaeological excavations in the country. The coin was minted in a period when the use of coins had just begun. The rare find contributes information concerning the way trade was carried out, and the process whereby global commerce moved from payment by weighing silver pieces, to the use of coins. The coin belongs to a group of very early coins that were minted outside Israel, in the regions of ancient Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. In the 6th\u20135th centuries BCE, such coins began to appear at sites in the Land of Israel.\u00a0 An additional indication of the gradual process is the fact that, although the silver coin was minted as a coin, it was found intentionally cut into two. This indicates that in the 4th century BCE, it was used as a weighed piece of silver, rather than as a coin, even though coins were current in this period. According to Michal Mermelstein and Danny Benayoun, Excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, \u201cThe site was situated in the rural area of the Kingdom of Judah, whose capital was in Jerusalem. It was first settled in the First Temple period, in the 7th century BCE (2,700 years ago), during the reigns of the kings of Judah, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon and Josiah, a peak settlement period in the kingdom of Judah. A characteristic \u2018four-room house\u2019 was uncovered from this period, and the sheqel weight, found on the floor of one of the rooms in the house, provides early evidence for trade. The dome-shaped stone weight would have been used for weighing metals, spices, and other expensive commodities. The sign on the weight was an ancient Egyptian (hieratic) abbreviation for the word sheqel, and the single incised stroke represents one sheqel. The weight weighs 11.07 g. \u201cThis was in effect a standard weight in the region of the kingdom of Judah, showing that commodities were carefully weighed in the markets,\u201d say the archaeologists. \u00a0 Moriya Reef, an engineer and Southern Region Projects Department Manager for Netivei Israel: \"We began the substantial project on Highway 375, which aims toward expanding into a two-lane, two-way highway, 8 km long, including arranging junctions and expanding the existing underpasses on the route. We fully recognized that this area required collaboration with the Antiquities Authority for the possibility of discovering archeological findings at any point throughout the job site. We enabled them to conduct their work parallel to the progress on the highway, and there is no doubt that its findings are amazing. The thought that discovering such important and meaningful findings \u00a0thanks to initiating an infrastructure project is undoubtedly quite exciting\". According to Eli Escusido, Director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, \"It is always surprising, how important findings are discovered in unexpected places. The tiny coins are a crucial source of information in archaeology. They provide us visual details, inscriptions, and dates. Through a tiny object like a coin, it becomes possible to trace human thought processes and observe that our economic habits have remained largely unchanged for thousands of years - only the technology has changed. In this context, it is interesting to consider future archaeological research in a world that has adopted electronic commerce.\"",

Following is the full speech by the President: Beloved families, my sisters and brothers, dear citizens of Israel. One hundred days, one hundred long days of captivity. One hundred terrible days of loneliness. One hundred days in which the hostages: babies, children, the elderly, women, and men, the wounded and sick, are threatened by despicable Hamas terrorists, held in diabolical cruelty, in the dark, in tunnels, without medical treatment, in terrible suffering. A hundred days of worry and fear. A hundred days of uncertainty, not knowing what will happen to them. One hundred days in which the heart of an entire nation beats together with you - beloved families. A hundred days in which each of us feels that the whole world is missing, that this horror is ever-present in our lives, in its most tangible and terrible sense. A hundred days in which we remember very well that the responsibility for any harm to our hostages lies with the murderers of Hamas, those who kidnapped, those who tortured, those who slaughtered. One hundred days of prayer, of hope, of expectation. A hundred days in which our hearts have burned with pain and frustration. A hundred days in which we all count the seconds and minutes. A hundred days in which we hear the voices of our sisters and brothers calling out to us from under the ground. A hundred days in which we call out to the Gates of Heaven with the cry: 'Let my people go!' Dear families, friends, even as we call and cry out now, we are faced with a bitter, cynical, and vicious enemy. And so I have an important message for you, I came here tonight as the President of the State of Israel to tell you in the name of the entire nation, and in the name of many all over the world: You, dear families, you are not alone, and we will not allow you to be alone. Not now, and not ever. Your heroism and your strength of stature give us all strength in the unwavering struggle to return our daughters and sons from the hands of a cruel and inhumane enemy. A whole nation is united together with you, tethered resolutely to the duty of returning all the hostages home, and restoring security for all Israeli citizens. Because the return of the hostages is beyond any debate, beyond any dispute. This is our deep moral order \u2013 the call to duty of a people and a state. I wish to speak to the world and say in English, and convey through all the networks broadcasting from here: (In English) \u201cFrom Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, a symbol of solidarity and humanity, I call upon the entire family of nations to do your part. This isn\u2019t just about our battle, it is a battle for the entire world. Stand with life and liberty against barbarism and hate. Stand with freedom and democracy, stand with our hostages, and help bring them back home. There is no \u201clater\u201d. The time to act is now. (In Hebrew)We cannot allow the issue of the hostages to fall from the public and global agenda, until the very last one of the hostages is freed. I commit to continue acting to ensure this, in every way and with every tool at my disposal. For their sake, and for our sake. And from here - from Hostage Square, I offer strength to the soldiers and commanders of the IDF and the security forces, who risk their lives to defeat the enemy, and bring the hostages home. I embrace the bereaved families and the many wounded in body and soul. I would like to thank all of you here and everyone who has been working for a hundred days with dedication, with indefatigable love for the return of the hostages home. All who have been working for this, thousands on behalf of the state and of course in Israeli society \u2013 especially in the Hostage Families' Forum, and among our friends all over the world - led by the United States. Because, yes dear families, your voice - the voice of the mothers and fathers calling their children to return home - has been with us for a hundred days, day and night, night and day. We stand together with you now \u2013 as the sun sets on this sacred day of mutual responsibility, and cry out: we are asking for our brothers and sisters, we demand our brothers and sisters. May G-d grant that they will return home to us soon, and the words of the Prophet will soon be fulfilled: 'And the faithful of G-d will return and come to Zion, eternal joy will be upon their heads, they will find happiness and joy, and they will forget grief and sorrow.'\u201d\u00a0",

        "content": "Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks [translated from Hebrew], today (Sunday, 14 January 2024), at the start of the Government meeting to approve the 2024 state budget: \"One hundred days ago, the Hamas monsters invaded the State of Israel and massacred us. They raped and burned our citizens and took them hostage. We have returned half of them. We are not giving up on anyone. \u00a0We are doing everything to bring them all back home. I emphasize: All of them, without exception. These efforts are continuing at all times, even at this moment. We will complete them at the same time as the completion of the other goals of the war. One of the things that has become clear beyond all doubt is that we must conduct this war, and it will yet take many months. Therefore, today we are submitting a war budget. While this budget is indeed an annual budget, it is a budget for a year in which we are at war. This requires us to incur far greater security expenditures than we planned. We also understand that we will need to invest in a multi-year plan to free the State of Israel from dependence on external acquisitions for many items \u2013 in local procurement, in local production capabilities; all of this will reach the Government table. But at this moment, what is required is, first of all, to cover the expenses of the war and to allow us to conduct the war in the coming year and complete it, including eliminating Hamas, returning our hostages and restoring security and the sense of security in both the north and the south so that the residents can return there. We will also submit here compensation and grants for reservists, the families of reservists, and the self-employed; they deserve a whole range of benefits. We are also submitting an increased budget for rebuilding the communities and the kibbutzim, and \u2013 of course \u2013 for returning the evacuees. We are busy here \u2013 first of all \u2013 with the step of achieving immediate security, but we are also laying the foundations for security for generations. Here I say \u2013 we must all share in the burden. When I say 'we must all' I mean all Government ministries. This is what is being done in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). According to a preliminary evaluation carried out by Prof. Simhon, he told me that the relative cut to the PMO budget is the largest among all ministries. I do not know if it is the biggest but I demand that everyone share in the burden and render assistance as necessary. I tell you that there are items about which I have not compromised: For example, tax credit points for parents of children aged 0-3, because this serves these people. These are usually people aged 30-40, they are now serving; this assists those who serve. I have also said that VAT will not be raised this year. We usually do not raise taxes. It seems to me that the only taxes that we are submitting in this budget and in this year are on bank profits. There is also a tax on cigarettes. I know that there is good news about the investments we are providing to the Intel plant and the high-tech industry, but \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 there is vast investment in security. This requires what are called 'adaptations' \u2013 this is a clean term for cuts. This is the truth, and this is how it is interpreted. Even so, the deficit will be increased because financing such a large increase in the security budget will also come as a result of our having to temporarily increase the deficit for this year, because we have a very strong economy, which we have built here together over the past 20 years, one of the most splendid economies in the world. We have the possibility of increasing the deficit but on the other hand we must do the adaptations. I request that you all take the initiative to share in the burden. This is what I ask of all of you. I know that we will yet deliberate during the day but this is my goal: I expect that in the coming day, in the next 24 hours, I am prepared to sit here as long as necessary, and if possible in the coming night we will finish this. We will submit a war budget for the State of Israel, a budget that ensures our security and our future. I thank you in advance.\"\u00a0",

The Hamas terrorist organization is working to advance attacks against targets in the Middle East, Africa and Europe under the command of senior organization leaders. On 14 December 2023, the Danish and German security and enforcement authorities announced the widespread arrest of suspects in Europe who are now the subject of judicial proceedings. In a continuing intelligence effort, considerable information has been uncovered that proves how the Hamas terrorist organization has acted to expand its violent activity abroad in order to attack innocents around the world. Thanks to combined inter-organizational forces in Israel and abroad, a comprehensive and in-depth picture of Hamas's terrorist activities has been revealed, including details of areas of action, targets for attacks and those involved in implementing the activity \u2013 from Hamas commanders in Lebanon to the last attackers in the operational infrastructure, as well as information on the intention to attack the Israeli Embassy in Sweden, the acquisition of UAVs and the use of elements from criminal organizations in Europe. Hamas draws inspiration from the terrorist activity of the Iranian regime, and like it, aspires to attack Israeli, Jewish and Western targets at any price. The Mossad, the ISA and the IDF, in conjunction with the international security and enforcement bodies, will continue their efforts to thwart the terrorist intentions of Hamas and all terrorist organizations, and to settle accounts with them everywhere in the world, on behalf of the security of the State of Israel and the Jewish people. \u00a0",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening (Saturday, 13 January 2024), at the Kirya in Tel Aviv [translated from Hebrew]: \"Citizens of Israel, may we have a good week. Today, we mark 100 days of the war, 100 days since the terrible day on which our citizens were massacred and taken hostage. We are continuing the war until the end \u2013 until total victory, until we achieve all of our goals: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel. We will restore security to both the south and the north. Nobody will stop us \u2013 not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else. The hypocritical onslaught at The Hague against the state of the Jews that arose from the ashes of the Holocaust, at the behest of those who came to perpetrate another Holocaust against the Jews \u2013 is a moral low point in the history of nations. In the murder tunnels of Gaza, our forces have found copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf. In a home in Gaza, they found a child's tablet with a picture of Hitler as the screensaver. Not for nothing did German Chancellor Scholz, after viewing the atrocities of the October 7 massacre, say: 'Hamas are the new Nazis.' Yesterday, I spoke with Chancellor Scholz and I thanked him for Germany's willingness to send a delegation to The Hague to help refute this despicable lie. But see the depth of the absurdity and the hypocrisy: Supporters of the new Nazis dare to accuse us of genocide. Who do they support? Murderers, rapists, those who decapitate and those who burn babies?! What brazen gall. What a disgrace. The State of Israel, the IDF and our security services are fighting a moral and just war that is without parallel, against the Hamas monsters, the new Nazis. This international campaign of denigration will not weaken either our hand or our determination to fight until the end, because something has changed in the history of our people. The antisemitism is the same antisemitism but the status of the Jewish people has fundamentally changed. Because today we have a state. Today we have defense forces and heroic soldiers to protect our people. What happened on October 7 will not happen again. This is our mission. This is our obligation. Tomorrow we will submit a budget that will ensure the continuation of the war: More money \u2013 a lot more \u2013 for security. More compensation and grants for reservists, families, the self-employed and for all who are bearing the burden. More assistance to return evacuees to their homes and for rebuilding the communities and the kibbutzim. Citizens of Israel, we are on the path to victory. We will not stop until we achieve victory. I know that there are those who doubt this \u2013 I am not among them. I hear your call and know that you, citizens of Israel, are not among them either. We are doing this together to the end. I believe in our people, in our soldiers and commanders, and I believe that after the massacre of October 7, we will not compromise on anything less than total victory. I say this, on your behalf, to every world leader who I speak with \u2013 we will not compromise and we will not stop. We are continuing until victory; we have no other choice. I have heard commentators in studios who explain 'This is not possible. This is not necessary.' Then I \u2013 and you also \u2013 say: It is possible, it is necessary and we will do it. In recent weeks, we have proven to Hamas and Hezbollah that every terrorist is a dead man, wherever they are. We are continuing to eliminate many terrorists and we are doing so in two ways: In forceful military activity in which most Hamas battalions have been eliminated and clearing actions to eliminate additional terrorists left in the field, above and below ground. These actions take time. Several days ago, I met with Secretary of State Blinken. I thanked him for the American assistance and I emphasized to him: We embarked on this war after we were massacred. We are not stopping. We are continuing until we eliminate Hamas and return our hostages. I told him something else: This is not just our war \u2013 it is also your war. This is the war of the sons of light against the sons of darkness. This is a war against the axis of evil led by Iran and its three proxies: Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis. And I added \u2013 I do not forget, not even for a moment, that in addition to the war in Gaza, in addition to the return of our hostages and the return of the residents to their homes in both the north and the south, we have another, constant, existential mission \u2013 to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons. This is my mission. This is our mission. I told Secretary of State Blinken: 'This needs to be your highest mission too.' Citizens of Israel, we are at a national moment of truth. We are fighting not only to restore our security now, we are fighting to ensure our security for generations. This war is exacting a heavy price from us. Last week we lost Lt.-Col. Roi Yosef Mordechai, a Nahal Brigade commander who volunteered to fight in Gaza. Roi survived the terrorist attack on the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva in Jerusalem 16 years ago in which eight of his friends were murdered. He left behind his wife Neta and infant daughter Ori. Ori did not manage to know her father, his spirit of voluntarism, his courage and the Zionism that pulsed within him. Roi's father, Eli, eulogized him: 'It is said that the Holy One, blessed be He, takes the very best. But he does not take \u2013 they give.' The sacrifice of Roi and our heroic soldiers who have fallen amidst boundless courage are a fresh and painful testimony to the heavy price that we all \u2013 as a state and as a people \u2013 are paying in order to live free in our land and return our hostages. I embrace my brothers and sisters from the bereaved families. Our heroic loved ones have paid the heaviest price in falling in defense of the homeland. I embrace the families of the hostages, with whom I and my wife meet all the time. These are personal, heart-rending meetings. We embrace them and listen to them. We look at the photos of their loved ones \u2013 our loved ones. I gave them a clear promise and I repeat it today: I will not give up on anyone. We are obligated to returning them all home. I embrace the wounded who have shown utmost heroism in the face of their war injuries. Every one of our fighters and commanders are true heroes who have given their souls to restore security to our country and return the residents to their homes \u2013 and so it will be. As is written in this week's Haftarah: 'then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob; and they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards.' [Ezekiel 28:25-26]. Together we will fight, and with G-d's help \u2013 together we will win.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE Proceedings instituted by South Africa against\u00a0the State of Israel on 29 December 2023(South Africa v. Israel) Co-Agent\u2019s Opening Statement Dr. Tal Becker(30 minutes)\u00a0 Madame President, Distinguished Members of the Court, It is an honor to appear before you again on behalf of the State of Israel. 1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The State of Israel is singularly aware of why the Genocide Convention, which has been invoked in these proceedings, was adopted. Seared in our collective memory is the systematic murder of six million Jews as part of a pre-meditated and heinous program for their total annihilation. 2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Given the Jewish people\u2019s history, it is not surprising that Israel was among the first States to ratify the Genocide Convention, without reservation, and to incorporate its provisions in its domestic legislation. For some, the promise of \u201cNever Again\u201d for all peoples is a slogan; for Israel, it is the highest moral obligation. 3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew who witnessed the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust, is credited with coining the term Genocide. He helped the world recognize that the existing legal lexicon was simply inadequate to capture the devasting evil that the Nazi Holocaust unleashed.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant has now sought to invoke this term in the context of Israel\u2019s conduct in a war it did not start and did not want. A war in which Israel is defending itself against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist organizations whose brutality knows no bounds.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The civilian suffering in this war, like in all wars, is tragic. It is heartbreaking. The harsh realities of the current hostilities are made especially agonizing for civilians given Hamas\u2019s reprehensible strategy of seeking to maximize civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimize it.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0But, as this Court has already made clear, the Genocide Convention was not designed to address the brutal impact of intensive hostilities on the civilian population, even when the use of force raises \u201cvery serious issues of international law\u201d and involves \u201cenormous suffering\u201d and \u201ccontinuing loss of life\u201d. \u00a0The Convention was set apart to address a malevolent crime of the most exceptional severity. 7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We live at a time when words are cheap. In an age of social media and identity politics, the temptation to reach for the most outrageous term, to vilify and demonize, has become for many irresistible. But if there is one place where words should still matter, where truth should still matter, it is surely a court of law. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant has regrettably put before the Court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture. The entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualized, and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities.\u00a0 9.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0South Africa purports to come to this Court in the lofty position of a guardian of the interest of humanity. But in delegitimizing Israel\u2019s 75-year existence in its opening presentation, that broad commitment to humanity rang hollow. And in its sweeping counter-factual description of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it seemed to erase both Jewish history and any Palestinian agency or responsibility. Indeed, the Application delegitimization of Israel since its very establishment in 1948 in its submissions, sounded barely distinguishable from Hamas\u2019s own rejectionist rhetoric.\u00a0 10.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It is unsurprising, therefore, that in the Applicant\u2019s telling, both Hamas\u2019s responsibility for the situation in Gaza, and the very humanity of its Israeli victims are removed from view.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a011.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The attempt to weaponize the term genocide against Israel in the present context, does more than tell the Court a grossly distorted story, and it does more than empty the word of its unique force and special meaning. It subverts the object and purpose of the Convention itself \u2013 with ramifications for all States seeking to defend themselves against those who demonstrate total disdain for life and for the law. Madame President, Members of the Court, 12.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On Saturday, October 7, a Jewish religious holiday, thousands of Hamas and other militants breached Israel\u2019s sovereign territory by sea, land, and air, invading over twenty Israeli communities, bases and the site of a music festival. What proceeded, under the cover of thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately into Israel, was the wholesale massacre, mutilation, rape and abduction of as many citizens as the terrorists could find before Israel\u2019s security forces repelled them. Openly displaying elation, they tortured children in front of their parents, and parents in front of their children, burned people, including infants, alive, and systematically raped and mutilated scores of women, men and children. All told, some 1,200 people were butchered that day, more than 5,500 maimed, and some 240 hostages abducted, including infants, entire families, persons with disabilities and Holocaust survivors, some of whom have since been executed; many of whom have been tortured, sexually abused and starved in captivity. \u00a0Representatives of the hostages\u2019 families are in this Court room today and we acknowledge their presence and their boundless suffering. 13.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We know of the brutality of October 7 not only from the harrowing testimonies of the survivors, the unmistakable proof of carnage and sadism left behind, and the forensic evidence taken at the scene. We know it because the assailants proudly filmed and broadcast their barbarism.\u00a0 14.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The events of that day are all but ignored in the Applicant\u2019s submissions. But we are compelled to share with the Court some fraction of its horror - the largest calculated mass murder of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.\u00a0 15.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We do so not because these acts - however sadistic and systematic - release Israel of its obligations to uphold the law as it defends its citizens and territory. That is unquestionable. We do so rather because it is impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza, without appreciating the nature of the threat Israel is facing, and the brutality and lawlessness of the armed force confronting it.\u00a0 16.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In the Volume of materials submitted to Members of the Court access has been provided to a portion of the raw footage for separate screening. But I am obliged to put before the Court today some small fragment of the scenes of unfathomable cruelty that took place in hundreds of locations on that horrible day.\u00a0 17.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Johnny Siman Tov, a wheat farmer, and his wife Tamar, an activist for women\u2019s rights, lived in Kibbutz Nir Oz. When the rocket fire started, they hid in the safe room with their 4 year-old son, Omer, and their 6 year-old twins, Arbel and Shachar. During their rampage, Hamas militants set fire to their house. Johnny texted his sister Ranae \u201cThey\u2019re here. They\u2019re burning us. We\u2019re suffocating\u201d. The whole family was burned alive, to ashes, making DNA identification especially difficult. \u00a0 18.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A survivor of the Nova music festival massacre testified to police to witnessing a Hamas militant brutally raping a young woman, as another militant cut off her breast and toyed with it. A second militant then raped her again, shooting her in the head while still inside her. \u00a0 19.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In one video recorded by a home surveillance system, a Hamas militant throws a grenade into a safe room where a father and his two sons have rushed to hide. The father is killed; the two sons are injured and bleeding as a militant pulls them into the living room. One child can be heard screaming to his brother, \u201cWhy am I alive? I can\u2019t see anything. They\u2019re going to kill us\u201d. The militant casually opens the fridge, takes out a bottle and drinks. \u00a0 20.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And then there is this [Screen Clip 1]: [In yet another recording, a Hamas militant called Mahmoud, is heard excitedly calling his parents from Kibbutz Mefalsim. \u201cOpen my Whatsapp\u201d he says \u201cLook how many I killed with my own hands. Your son killed Jews!\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you from a Jewish woman\u2019s phone. I killed her and I killed her husband. I killed ten with my own hands!\u201d. \u201cDad, ten with my own hands\u201d he shouts with palpable joy. \u201cMom, your son is hero\u201d, he says]. \u00a0\u00a0 21.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As stated, none of these atrocities absolve Israel of its obligations under the law. But they do enable the Court to appreciate three core aspects of the present proceedings, which the Applicant has obscured from view. 22.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0First, that if there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel. If there is a concern about the obligations of States under the Genocide Convention, then it is in relation to their responsibilities to act against Hamas\u2019s proudly declared agenda of annihilation, which is not a secret, and is not in doubt.\u00a0 23.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The annihilationist language of Hamas\u2019s Charter is repeated regularly by its leaders, \u00a0with the goal, in the words of one member Hamas\u2019s political bureau, of the \u201ccleansing of Palestine of the filth of the Jews\u201d. \u00a0It is expressed no less chillingly in the words of senior Hamas member, Ghazi Hamad, to Lebanese Television on October 24th, 2023 who refers to the October 7th attacks, what Hamas calls the Al Aqsa Flood, as follows: [Screen clip 2] [\u201cThe Al Aqsa Flood\u201d, he says \u201cis just the first time, and there will be a second, a third and a fourth\u201d]. In the continuation of this interview, Hamad is asked: \u201cDoes that mean the annihilation of Israel\u201d. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d he answers. \u201cThe existence of Israel is illogical\u201d; and then says \u201cNobody should blame us for the things we do. On October 7, October 10, October 1,000,0000 \u2013 everything we do is justified\u201d. \u00a0Given that on October 7, before any military response by Israel, South Africa issued an official statement blaming Israel for the \u201crecent conflagration\u201d, \u00a0- essentially blaming Israel for the murder of its own citizens - one wonders whether the Applicant agrees. \u00a0 \u00a0 24.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Second, it is in response to the slaughter of October 7 \u2013 which Hamas openly vows to repeat - and to the ongoing attacks against it from Gaza, that Israel has the inherent right to take all legitimate measures to defend its citizens and secure the release of the hostages. This right is also not in doubt. It has been acknowledged by States across the world. \u00a0 25.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Astonishingly, the Court has been requested to indicate a provisional measure calling on Israel to suspend its military operations. But this amounts to an attempt to deny Israel its ability to meet its legal obligations to the defense of its citizens, to the hostages, and to over 110,000 internally displaced Israelis unable to safely return to their homes.\u00a0 26.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant in its submissions to the Court makes almost no mention of the ongoing humanitarian suffering of Israel\u2019s citizens at the hands of Hamas, \u00a0and treats the hostages still held in captivity, as barely afterthought. But is there a reason these people [on your screen] are unworthy of protection? [Show slide - 3]\u00a0 27.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hamas is not party to these proceedings. The Applicant, by its request, seeks to thwart Israel\u2019s inherent right to defend itself \u2013 to let Hamas not just get away with its murder, literally, but render Israel defenseless as Hamas continues to commit it.\u00a0 28.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday, Counsel for the Applicant made the astonishing claim that Israel was denied this right, and as a matter of fact should not be able to protect itself from Hamas\u2019 attacks. But allow me to draw attention to these words written by Professor Lowe: \u201cThe source of the attack, whether a state or non-state actor, is irrelevant to the existence of the right\u201d to self-defense. \u201cForce may be used to avert a threat because no-one, and no state, is obliged by law passively to suffer the delivery of an attack\u201d. \u00a0Israel agrees with these words, as I suspect would any sovereign State. 29.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If the claim of the Applicant now is that in the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, Israel must be denied the ability to defend its citizens \u2013 then the absurd upshot of South Africa\u2019s argument is this: Under the guise of the allegation against Israel of genocide, this Court is asked to call for an end to operations against the ongoing attacks of an organization that pursues an actual genocidal agenda. An organization that has violated every past ceasefire and used it to rearm and plan new atrocities. An organization that declares its unequivocal resolve to advance its genocidal plans. That is an unconscionable request, and it is respectfully submitted that it cannot stand.\u00a0 30.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Third, the Court is informed of the events of October 7 because, if there are any Provisional Measures that should appropriately be indicated here, they are indeed with respect to South Africa itself.\u00a0 31.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It is a matter of public record, that South Africa enjoys close relations with Hamas, despite its formal recognition as a terrorist organization by numerous States across the world. \u00a0These relations have continued unabated even after the October 7 atrocities. \u00a0South Africa has long hosted and celebrated its ties with Hamas figures, including a senior Hamas delegation that \u2013 incredibly \u2013 visited the country for a \u201csolidarity gathering\u201d just weeks after the massacre. \u00a0 32.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In justifying instituting these proceedings, South Africa makes much of its obligations under the Genocide Convention. It seems fitting, then, that it be instructed to comply with those obligations itself; to end its own language of de-legitimization of Israel\u2019s existence; end its support for Hamas; and to use its influence with this organization so that Hamas permanently ends its campaign of genocidal terror and releases the hostages.\u00a0 Madame President, Members of the Court,\u00a0 \u00a033.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The hostilities between Israel and Hamas have exacted a terrible toll on both Israelis and Palestinians. But any genuine effort to understand the cause of this toll must take account of the horrendous reality created by Hamas within the Gaza Strip.\u00a0 34.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When Israel withdrew all its soldiers and civilians from Gaza in 2005 it left a coastal area with the potential to become a political and economic success story. Hamas\u2019s violent take-over in 2007 changed all that. Over the past 16 years of its rule, Hamas has smuggled countless weapons into Gaza, and has diverted billions in international aid, not to build schools, hospitals or shelters to protect its population from the dangers of the attacks it launched against Israel over many years, but rather to turn massive swathes of the civilian infrastructure into perhaps the most sophisticated terrorist stronghold in the history of urban warfare. \u00a0 35.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Remarkably, counsel for South Africa described the suffering in Gaza as \u201cunparalleled and unprecedented\u201d, as if they are unaware of the utter devastation wrought in wars that have raged just in recent years around the world. Sadly, the civilian suffering in warfare is not unique to Gaza. What is actually \u201cunparalleled and unprecedented\u201d is the degree to which Hamas has entrenched itself within the civilian population, and made Palestinian civilian suffering an integral part of its strategy.\u00a0 36.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hamas has systematically and unlawfully embedded its military operations, militants and assets throughout Gaza within and beneath densely populated civilian areas. It has built an extensive warren of underground tunnels for its leaders and fighters several hundred miles in length throughout the Strip, with thousands of access points and terrorist hubs located in homes, mosques, UN facilities, schools and perhaps most shockingly hospitals. \u00a0 37.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This is not an occasional tactic. It is an integrated, preplanned, extensive and abhorrent method of warfare. Purposely and methodically murdering civilians. Firing rockets indiscriminately. Systematically using civilians, sensitive sites and civilian objects as shields. Stealing and hoarding humanitarian supplies - allowing those under its control to suffer, so that it can fuel its fighters and terrorist campaign. 38.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The appalling suffering of civilians \u2013 both Israeli and Palestinian \u2013 is first and foremost the result of this despicable strategy; the horrible cost of Hamas not only failing to protect its civilians but actively sacrificing them for its own propaganda and military benefit. And if Hamas abandons this strategy, releases the hostages and lays down its arms, the hostilities and suffering would end.\u00a0 Madame President, Members of the Court, 39.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0There are many distortions in the Applicant\u2019s submission to the Court, but as shall be demonstrated by Counsel, there is one that overshadows them all. In the Applicant\u2019s telling, it is almost as if there is no intensive armed conflict taking place between two parties at all, no grave threat to Israel and its citizens, only an Israeli assault against Gaza.\u00a0 40.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Court is told of widespread damage to buildings, but it is not told, for example, how many thousands of these buildings were destroyed because they were booby trapped by Hamas, how many became legitimate targets because of the strategy of using civilian objects and protected sites for military purposes, how many buildings were struck by over 2000 indiscriminate terrorist rockets that misfired and landed in Gaza itself.\u00a0 41.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Court is told of over 23,000 casualties, as the Applicant repeats, as many have, unverified statistics provided by Hamas itself \u2013 hardly a reliable source. \u00a0Every civilian casualty in this conflict is a human tragedy that demands our compassion. But the Court is not told how many thousands of casualties are in fact militants, how many were killed by Hamas fire, how many were civilians taking direct part in hostilities, and just how many are the tragic result of legitimate and proportionate use of force against military targets. \u00a0 42.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And the Court is also told of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, but it is not told of Hamas\u2019s practice of stealing and hoarding aid, \u00a0it is not told of the extensive Israeli efforts to mitigate civilian harm, \u00a0of the humanitarian initiatives being undertaken to enable the flow of supplies and provide medical attention to the wounded.\u00a0 43.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant purports to describe the reality in Gaza. But it is as if Hamas, and its total contempt for civilian life, just do not exist as a direct cause of that reality. Hamas is widely estimated to have over 30,000 fighters and is known to bring minors no older than 15 or 16 into its ranks. They are coming for us. But, in South Africa\u2019s telling, they have all but disappeared. There are no explosives in mosques and schools and children\u2019s bedrooms, no ambulances used to transport fighters, no tunnels and terrorist hubs under sensitive sites, no fighters dressed as civilians, no commandeering of aid trucks, no firing from civilian homes, UN facilities and even safe zones. There is only Israel acting in Gaza.\u00a0 44.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant is essentially asking the Court to substitute the lens of armed conflict between a State and a lawless terrorist organization, with the lens of a so-called genocide of a State against a civilian population. But it is not offering the Court a lens, it is offering it a blindfold. Madame President, Members of the Court \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 43.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The nightmarish environment created by Hamas has been concealed by the Applicant, but it is the environment in which Israel is compelled to operate. Israel is committed, as it must be, to comply with the law, but it does so in the face of Hamas\u2019s utter contempt for the law. It is committed, as it must be, to demonstrate humanity, but it does so in the face of Hamas\u2019s utter inhumanity 44.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As will be presented by Counsel, these commitments are a matter of express government policy, military directives and procedures. \u00a0They are also an expression of Israel\u2019s core values. And, as shall also be shown, they are matched by genuine measures on the ground to mitigate civilian harm under the unprecedented and excruciating conditions of warfare created by Hamas. \u00a0\u00a0 45.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It is plainly inconceivable \u2013 under the terms set by this very Court - that a State conducting itself in this way may be said to be engaged in Genocide, not even prima facie.\u00a0 46.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The key component of genocide - the intention to destroy a people in whole or in part - is totally lacking. What Israel seeks by operating in Gaza is not to destroy a people, but to protect a people, its people, who are under attack on multiple fronts, and to do so in accordance with the law, even as it faces a heartless enemy determined to use that very commitment against it. 47.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As will be detailed by Counsel, Israel\u2019s lawful aims in Gaza have been clearly and repeatedly articulated by its Prime Minister, its Defense Minister, and all members of the War Cabinet. As the Prime Minister reiterated yet again just this week \u201cIsrael is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the civilian population\u201d. \u00a0 48.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Israel aims to ensure that Gaza can never again be used as a launch pad for terrorism. As the Prime Minister reaffirmed, Israel seeks neither to permanently occupy Gaza or to displace its civilian population. \u00a0It wants to create a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike, where both can live in peace, thrive and prosper, and where the Palestinian people have all the power to govern themselves, but not the capacity to threaten Israel.\u00a0 49.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If there is a threat to that vision - if there is a humanitarian threat to the Palestinian civilians of Gaza - it stems primarily from the fact that they have lived under the control of a genocidal terrorist organization that has total disregard for their life and well-being. That organization, Hamas, and its sponsors, seek to deny Israel, Palestinians, and Arab States across the region, the ability to advance a common future of peace, co-existence, security, and prosperity. Israel is in a war of defense against Hamas - not against the Palestinian people - to ensure that they do not succeed. 50.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In these circumstances, there can hardly be a charge more false or more malevolent than the allegation against Israel of genocide. 51.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Applicant has, regrettably, engaged in a transparent attempt to abuse the Convention\u2019s compulsory jurisdiction mechanism, and in particular the Provisional Measures phase of proceedings, to bring under the purview of the Court matters over which, in truth, it lacks jurisdiction.\u00a0 52.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Madame President, Members of the Court, the Genocide Convention was a solemn promise made to the Jewish people, to all peoples, of \u201cNever Again\u201d. The Applicant invites the Court to betray that promise. If the term genocide can be so diminished in the way it advocates, if Provisional Measures can be triggered in the way it suggests, the Convention becomes an aggressor\u2019s charter. It will reward, indeed encourage, the terrorists who hide behind civilians, at the expense of the States seeking to defend against them. \u00a0\u00a0 53.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To maintain the integrity of the Genocide Convention, to maintain its promise, and the Court\u2019s own role as its guardian, it is respectfully submitted that this Application and Request should be dismissed for what they are \u2013 a libel, designed to deny Israel the right to defend itself according to the law from the unprecedented terrorist onslaught it continues to face, and to free the 136 hostages Hamas still holds.\u00a0 54.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0I thank you for your kind attention. May I ask, Madame President, that you call Professor Shaw to the podium.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "content": "Today we witnessed one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims. South Africa, which is functioning as the legal arm of the Hamas terrorist organization, utterly distorted the reality in Gaza following the October 7 massacre and completely ignored the fact that Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, murdered, executed, massacred, raped and abducted Israeli citizens, simply because they were Israelis, in an attempt to carry out genocide. South Africa seeks to allow Hamas to return to commit the war crimes, crimes against humanity and sexual crimes they committed repeatedly on October 7, as its leaders have stated. Hamas\u2019 representatives in the Court, the South African lawyers, are also ignoring the fact that Hamas uses the civilian population in Gaza as human shields and operates from within hospitals, schools, UN shelters, mosques and churches with the intention of endangering the lives of the residents of the Gaza Strip. 136 abductees are being held in Hamas captivity, denied access to Red Cross representatives and medical care. The State of Israel will continue to protect its citizens in accordance with international law, while distinguishing between Hamas terrorists and the civilian population, and will work for the release of all abductees and the elimination of the Hamas terrorist organization, a racist and antisemitic terrorist organization that calls in its Covenant for the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jews.\u00a0",

        "content": "(Communicated by the State Department Spokesperson\u2019s Office)\u00a0 Remarks by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, at the David Kempinski Hotel this evening (Tuesday, 9 January 2024) in Tel Aviv: SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Good evening.\u00a0 This is my fourth trip to Israel since the horrific Hamas attacks of October 7th, so I\u2019m here just over three months \u2013 95 days \u2013 since those attacks occurred. We know that for the people who were most affected by the attacks and the conflict that\u2019s followed, time moves differently.\u00a0 Immediately before this, I met with the families of hostages being held in Gaza and with hostages who\u2019ve been released. \u00a0Several of those families I\u2019ve now met multiple times. \u00a0For them, every day, every hour, every minute that they\u2019re separated from their loved ones is an eternity.\u00a0 Time feels different for families in Gaza as well, hundreds of thousands of whom are experiencing acute food insecurity. \u00a0For the mother or father trying to find something to feed a hungry child, the passage of another day without food is excruciating. \u00a0 Time also feels different for Israelis and Palestinians whose innocent loved ones have been killed. \u00a0For them, time often falls into \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d \u2013 the \u201cafter\u201d filled with a loss that most of us will never know and cannot fully imagine. \u00a0 And those are just a few examples of how heavy these 95 days have felt \u2013 and continue to feel \u2013 for the people most affected by this conflict.This immense human toll is one of the many reasons that we continue to stand with Israel in ensuring that October 7th can never happen again. \u00a0It\u2019s also why we\u2019re intensely focused on bringing the remaining hostages home, addressing the humanitarian crisis and strengthening protection of civilians in Gaza, and preventing the conflict from spreading.\u00a0And it\u2019s the reason we\u2019re working urgently to forge a path toward lasting peace and security in this region. We believe the submission against Israel to the International Court of Justice distracts the world from all of these important efforts. \u00a0And moreover, the charge of genocide is meritless.\u00a0 It\u2019s particularly galling, given that those who are attacking Israel \u2013 Hamas, Hizballah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter, Iran \u2013 continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.\u00a0 On this trip, I came to Israel after meeting with the leaders of T\u00fcrkiye, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia. All of those leaders share our concern about the spread of the conflict. \u00a0All of them are committed to using their influence, using the ties that they have to prevent it from escalating, to deter new fronts from opening.\u00a0 In addition, all expressed grave concern about the dire humanitarian situation and the number of civilians killed in Gaza.\u00a0 We know that facing an enemy that embeds itself among civilians \u2013 who hides in and fires from schools, from hospitals \u2013 makes this incredibly challenging. \u00a0But the daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high.\u00a0 Important progress has been made in increasing the amount of aid getting into Gaza, including by opening Kerem Shalom.\u00a0 Nonetheless, 90 percent of Gaza\u2019s population continues to face acute food insecurity, according to the United Nations. \u00a0For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences. \u00a0 As I underscored in our meetings today, more food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza. \u00a0And then once they\u2019re in Gaza, they need to get more effectively to the people who need them. \u00a0 And Israel needs to do everything it can to remove any obstacles from crossings to other parts of Gaza. \u00a0Improving deconfliction procedures to ensure that the aid can move safely and securely is a critical part of that. \u00a0 The United Nations is playing an indispensable role in addressing the immense humanitarian needs in Gaza. \u00a0There is simply no alternative. UN personnel and other aid workers in Gaza are demonstrating extraordinary courage by continuing to provide lifesaving services in what are extremely challenging conditions.\u00a0 I spoke last night with the UN\u2019s new Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag about all of these efforts that are underway.\u00a0 Now, Sigrid Kaag is someone I worked very closely with a few years ago, when she led the UN mission that destroyed the Assad regime\u2019s chemical weapons in Syria. \u00a0So, I can say from experience she has what it takes to get this job done.\u00a0 She has America\u2019s full support. \u00a0She must have Israel\u2019s as well.\u00a0 Today, we also discussed the phased transition of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. \u00a0We continue to offer our best advice for how Israel can achieve its essential goal of ensuring that October 7th can never be repeated. \u00a0And we believe Israel has achieved significant progress toward this fundamental objective.\u00a0 As Israel\u2019s campaign moves to a lower-intensity phase in northern Gaza, and as the IDF scales down its forces there, we agreed today on a plan for the UN to carry out an assessment mission. \u00a0It will determine what needs to be done to allow displaced Palestinians to return safely to homes in the north.\u00a0 Now, this is not going to happen overnight. \u00a0There are serious security, infrastructure, and humanitarian challenges. \u00a0But the mission will start a process that evaluates these obstacles and how they can be overcome.\u00a0 In today\u2019s meetings I was also crystal clear: \u00a0Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow. \u00a0They must not be pressed to leave Gaza. \u00a0As I told the prime minister, the United States unequivocally rejects any proposals advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza, and the prime minister reaffirmed to me today that this is not the policy of Israel\u2019s government. We also spoke about the tensions on Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, where Hizballah continues to launch daily rocket attacks on Israel. \u00a0As I told the war cabinet and other senior officials, the United States stands with Israel in ensuring its northern border is secure. \u00a0We\u2019re fully committed to working with Israel to find a diplomatic solution that avoids escalation and allows families to return to their homes, to live securely in northern Israel and also in southern Lebanon. Finally, we continue to discuss how to build a more durable peace and security for Israel within the region. \u00a0As I told the prime minister, every partner that I met on this trip said that they\u2019re ready to support a lasting solution that ends the long-running cycle of violence and ensures Israel\u2019s security. \u00a0But they underscored that this can only come through a regional approach that includes a pathway to a Palestinian state. These goals are attainable, but only if they\u2019re pursued together. \u00a0This crisis has clarified you can\u2019t have one without the other, and you can\u2019t achieve either goal without an integrated regional approach.\u00a0 To make this possible, Israel must be a partner to Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people in living side by side in peace with Israel and as neighbors. \u00a0And Israel must be \u2013 must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians\u2019 ability to govern themselves effectively. \u00a0Extremist settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions all make it harder, not easier, for Israel to achieve lasting peace and security. The Palestinian Authority also has a responsibility to reform itself, to improve its governance \u2013 issues I plan to raise with President Abbas, among others, when we meet tomorrow.\u00a0If Israel wants its Arab neighbors to make the tough decisions necessary to help ensure its lasting security, Israeli leaders will have to make hard decisions themselves.\u00a0 When President Biden addressed the people of Israel days after the October 7th attack, he made a very simple pledge: \u00a0The United States has Israel\u2019s back today, tomorrow, always. \u00a0The friendship between our nations is truly exceptional. \u00a0It\u2019s our unique bond and America\u2019s enduring commitment to the people of Israel that allows \u2013 indeed, demands \u2013 that we\u2019re as forthright as possible in the moments when the stakes are highest, when the choices matter the most. \u00a0This is one of those moments. Happy to take some questions. MR MILLER: \u00a0The first question goes to Simon Lewis with Reuters.\u00a0 QUESTION: \u00a0Thank you. \u00a0Mr. Secretary, the future of the Gaza Strip has been a theme of your trip while you\u2019ve been visiting regional countries. \u00a0I wonder today were you able to do any \u2013 make any progress on closing the gap between Arab leaders and Israel on specific security, reconstruction, and governance arrangements for Gaza.\u00a0 And you talked before leaving Saudi Arabia yesterday about the need for a practical pathway to a Palestinian state as part of any efforts towards regional integration, and obviously that\u2019s come up today in your meetings with the cabinet. \u00a0Has Prime Minister Netanyahu changed his mind? \u00a0Is he still opposed to the creation of a separate Palestinian state, or have you managed to convince him or get any guarantees that this is something that can happen?\u00a0 SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0So one of the things that I heard very clearly on this trip \u2013 these two questions are actually joined \u2013 is many countries in the region are really prepared to invest in a number of ways, to invest when the conflict in Gaza is over in its reconstruction, in its security, supporting Palestinians in their governance. \u00a0But it is essential to them that there also be a clear pathway to the realization of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state.\u00a0 And I think the view that they have expressed is that critical to ending once and for all the cycle of violence that is only going to repeat itself at some point in the future is through the realization of Palestinian political rights. \u00a0That was a very clear message that I heard everywhere I went, just as I heard, again, a commitment not only to be engaged in the future of Gaza, but also to take the steps necessary, make the commitments necessary, provide the assurances necessary to give Israel confidence in its security. \u00a0And that\u2019s something that\u2019s new in recent years and very powerful, which is the willingness, the commitment of many neighboring countries not only to live with Israel in peace but also genuinely to have a region that\u2019s more integrated in which everyone can feel secure, including Israel. So there\u2019s a \u2013 I think a \u2013 also here a potentially powerful opportunity for the future. \u00a0Now, very difficult to get there, hard to get there; hard decisions, hard choices need to be made in order to get there. \u00a0But you can see that possibility. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to speak for the prime minister or anyone in the Israeli Government about their views. \u00a0I can just share our own, and also share a little bit of what I heard from countries in the region. MR MILLER: \u00a0For the next question, Suleiman Maswadeh with Kan News. QUESTION: \u00a0Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for taking questions. \u00a0I\u2019ll do it very fast. \u00a0The Israeli Government is still refusing to transfer the PA\u2019s money, and the Minister of Finance Smotrich said yesterday there are 2 million Nazis in Gaza, and I won\u2019t give money to Nazis, just like the U.S. won\u2019t give money to al-Qaida. \u00a0I would like to have your comment on that. \u00a0And the second question is the cabinet said \u2013 the war cabinet said that they are not \u2013 they are refusing to let Gazans go back to north Gaza for now. \u00a0Is that something that you agreed on with your Israeli counterparts? \u00a0Thank you very much. SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0So first with regard to the Palestinian Authority revenues, these are their revenues. \u00a0They should have them. \u00a0They should have them in order to be able to make sure that they can pay their people who are providing essential services, including doing essential work in the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority security forces who are playing a very important role in trying to keep peace, security, and stability in the West Bank \u2013 something that\u2019s profoundly in Israel\u2019s interest. \u00a0So we believe that those revenues should be released to them. \u00a0Again, their revenues, and being used to do something that\u2019s important to Israel.\u00a0 And when it comes to the future governance of Gaza when the conflict is over, of course people need to be paid. \u00a0They need to be able to do the work necessary to administer Gaza, to do the other things that will be critical once the conflict ends. In terms of Palestinians and moving back north in Gaza, as I spoke to earlier, we have an agreement that the UN will now conduct an assessment to determine the conditions necessary for people to be able to move back home. \u00a0There are a lot of really challenging and important issues to deal with, including things like unexploded ordnance, booby traps, and other explosives that have been left by Hamas; infrastructure questions, proper support \u2013 all of those things are going to be evaluated by the United Nations pursuant to this agreement. \u00a0And then as soon as conditions allow, we want to see people be able to move back to their homes. \u00a0And we\u2019ve been very clear about the necessity of doing that when conditions allow, and making sure that if people want to go back, they can go back. MR MILLER: \u00a0Will Mauldin with The Wall Street Journal. QUESTION: \u00a0Thank you so much. \u00a0I just wanted to ask about \u2013 we\u2019ve heard some voices among Israeli political leaders talking about the threat of Iran in the region, and of course its proxies, Hizballah and the Houthis, have been active in and around this conflict. \u00a0And \u2013 but you\u2019re bringing a message to the region of de-escalation. \u00a0Was your message of de-escalation heard and agreed with when you spoke to your Israeli counterparts and political leaders today, or \u2013 we haven\u2019t \u2013 certainly haven\u2019t seen that in the last few days. \u00a0There have been strikes on Hizballah that would appear to be an escalation. \u00a0Do you support that, and is the U.S. and its partners \u2013 are they prepared to take a strike against the Houthis because of their continued action in and around the Red Sea? \u00a0Thank you. SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Thanks, Will. \u00a0One thing that we\u2019ve heard clearly every place we\u2019ve gone, including in Israel, is that escalation is in no one\u2019s interest. \u00a0No one\u2019s seeking it. \u00a0No one wants to see other fronts opened in this conflict. \u00a0And more than that, as I\u2019ve already shared, we have countries around the region that are using their relationships, using their influence, to try to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen. \u00a0We had extensive discussions about that today, as we had on other days of this trip. \u00a0And here we focused particularly on the situation in northern Israel. \u00a0And it\u2019s very clear to me from these conversations a few things.\u00a0 First, we strongly support the proposition that Israelis need to know security so that they can return to their homes in northern Israel. \u00a0Eighty-thousand or so Israelis have been forced from their homes because of insecurity from \u2013 coming from southern Lebanon, the rocket attacks, other threats posed by Hizballah. \u00a0Equally, we believe \u2013 and the Government of Israel believes \u2013 that a diplomatic path is the best way to achieve that security, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to pursue. \u00a0It\u2019s what the government said today, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u00a0 More broadly, we have \u2013 you\u2019re right \u2013 a number of actions being taken by the Houthis, by other Iranian proxies in Iraq, in Syria, that threaten stability and threaten the potential for conflict. \u00a0And we\u2019re determined, again, that we not see escalation, that we don\u2019t have the conflict spread, and we\u2019ve made that very clear. \u00a0But, of course, if our personnel, if our forces are threatened or attacked, we\u2019ll take appropriate steps. \u00a0We\u2019ll respond. \u00a0We\u2019ll protect them. \u00a0We\u2019ve demonstrated that in the recent past, and we will again if we have to. \u00a0We talked already about the threat that the Houthis are posing. \u00a0That\u2019s a threat not to us \u2013 just to us or to Israel; it\u2019s a threat to the entire international community because they\u2019ve been attacking shipping through the Red Sea that\u2019s vital to providing \u2013 it provides about 15 percent of global commerce every day.\u00a0 These attacks have had very, very negative affects for countries around the world in terms of forcing ships to route around the Red Sea \u2013 take longer routes, more expensive, more time, insurance rates goes up; prices for food, for medicine, for energy, for whatever\u2019s being shipped are going up. \u00a0And more broadly, it\u2019s a threat to the principle of freedom of navigation that every country has a stake in. \u00a0That\u2019s why more than 40 countries joined us in condemning the Houthi actions. \u00a0That\u2019s why other countries have joined us in making clear that if this continues, there are going to be consequences.\u00a0 But no one was looking to create a conflict or to escalate a conflict. \u00a0On the contrary, we\u2019re seeking to prevent that from happening, but we also have to uphold basic principles of international law, including freedom of navigation \u2013 and we have to make sure that our own personnel when they\u2019re under threat are being protected.\u00a0 QUESTION: \u00a0You said there are going to be consequences. \u00a0Does that mean there has been a decision by the U.S. or its partners to take action?SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Look, I\u2019m not going to speculate on what will happen in the future. \u00a0We just want to make clear that if these actions by the Houthis continues, there will be consequences. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to say anything beyond that.\u00a0MR MILLER: \u00a0For the final question, Walid Al-Omari with Al Jazeera.\u00a0QUESTION: \u00a0Thank you. \u00a0Walid Al-Omari, Al Jazeera bureau chief in Jerusalem. \u00a0First let me, Mr. Secretary Blinken, thank you for expressing your deep sadness about the tragedy of our dear colleague Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza Wael al-Dahdouh. \u00a0Wael has lost his wife and three sons and his grandchildren in an Israeli bombardment of the house where they were fled from the center of Gaza City and displaced to the southern Gaza strip in 25th of October. \u00a0Two days ago or three days ago he lost his eldest son Hamza who was a journalist in Al Jazeera media network and was killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a civilian car in Rafah. \u00a0One-hundred-and-ten Palestinian journalists were killed so far by Israeli army in Gaza during the war. \u00a0More than 20,000 civilians were killed, and tens of thousands were injured, and hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes that no longer exist. \u00a0The situation of the Israeli citizens is also difficult. \u00a0Tens of thousands were displaced from the Gaza envelope and the border line with Lebanon, and hundreds of civilians were killed in the Hamas attack on the 7th of October. \u00a0And there are many prisoners and hostages from both sides, as you know.\u00a0 My question: \u00a0Why do you as a superpower and as leading force in the international community not oblige the parties and especially the Israeli Government to cease fire in Gaza and respect the United Nations resolutions and (inaudible) the peaceful solution instead of both sides continuing wash blood by more blood?\u00a0 My second question is related to the matter of normalization, and is the USA really busy with the matter, and do you think, Mr. Blinken, that the option exists or is it just an attempt to escape from the solution of the Palestinian question, and tempting Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, to agree with the American position in order to change his extreme government? \u00a0And what\u2019s about the role of the four Arab nations or countries, as you mentioned before, in Gaza? \u00a0It\u2019s just to contribute for the reconstruction, or they have political rule there?\u00a0 SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Okay. \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 QUESTION: \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0Let me just say again, at the outset, the loss \u2013 losses \u2013 that your colleague suffered are unimaginable, and I have deep condolences for what he has suffered. \u00a0I, again, can\u2019t even begin to fully imagine what he\u2019s gone through. \u00a0And as I said again the other day, to the journalists who\u2019ve lost their lives or have been injured in Gaza, we feel very strongly for them as well, and the essential work that they do is more vital than ever.\u00a0 We want this war to end as soon as possible. \u00a0There\u2019s been far too much loss of life, far too much suffering. \u00a0But it\u2019s vital that Israel achieve its very legitimate objectives of ensuring that October 7th can never happen again, and we believe they\u2019ve made considerable progress toward that goal.\u00a0 At the same time, I think it\u2019s very important to remember that everyone has choices to make, and that includes Hamas. \u00a0Hamas could have ended this on October 8th by not hiding behind civilians, by putting down its weapons, by surrendering, by releasing the hostages. \u00a0None of the suffering \u2013 none of the suffering \u2013 would have happened if Hamas hadn\u2019t done \u2013 did what it did on October 7th and had it made different decisions thereafter. \u00a0So it\u2019s very important to keep that in perspective, and again, this could end tomorrow if Hamas makes those decisions.\u00a0 We will continue, as we\u2019ve done, to give the Israelis our best advice about conducting this war in a manner that achieves the objective of making sure that October 7th can\u2019t be repeated, does better by protecting civilians, and making sure that people get the assistance that they need.\u00a0 With regard to normalization, there is, I think, a clear interest in pursuing that. \u00a0Integration of the region is something that virtually all of the countries that I visited on this trip want to advance, want to pursue. Some of them have already taken vital steps to do that. \u00a0Others, I think, are interested in doing the same. \u00a0But it\u2019s equally clear that that\u2019s not in substitute for or at the expense of a political horizon for the Palestinians and ultimately a Palestinian state. \u00a0On the contrary, that piece has to be a part of any integration efforts, any normalization efforts. \u00a0That was also very clear in my conversations during the course of this trip, including in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 QUESTION: \u00a0What about the (inaudible)? \u00a0Is there any political (inaudible)? SECRETARY BLINKEN: \u00a0So again, I think these things are somewhat joined. \u00a0It\u2019s clear that, as I mentioned before, most of the countries I visited are really prepared to I think support Gaza in the future, to support all the efforts that are necessary, and to support Palestinian-led governance for Gaza. \u00a0But it\u2019s also vitally important to them that there be a pathway forward for the Palestinians in terms of their overall political rights and a very clear political horizon. \u00a0We and they support Palestinian governance that\u2019s joined of Gaza and the West Bank, and the pathway to a state. \u00a0That\u2019s, again, very clear from everyone I talked to in the region.\u00a0 Thank you.",

        "content": "(Communicated by the President's Spokesperson) \u00a0 President Isaac Herzog this morning (Tuesday, 9 January 2024), met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was visiting Israel and the region. The meeting, held in Tel Aviv, was their fifth since the atrocities carried out by Hamas against Israel in October 7. President Herzog: \u201cGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning Secretary Blinken. As always, it's such a pleasure to have you here in Israel. We are very grateful to you for your support and for your steadfast commitment to Israel\u2019s safety and to making sure that Israel wins this war, because it's a war that affects international values and the values of the free world. Yesterday, I had a long conversation with the Vice President, it was a productive conversation. And I would reiterate what I told her: On Thursday, a proceeding will start in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, whereby South Africa has sued Israel for supposed genocide. There's nothing more atrocious and preposterous than this claim. Actually, our enemies, the Hamas, in their charter call for the destruction and annihilation of the State of Israel, the only nation state of the Jewish people. The Convention Against Genocide was enacted by the international community following the worst atrocities of humankind, the Shoah, the Holocaust, which was aimed specifically against the Jews, the Jewish people, in order to eliminate the Jewish race, the Jewish people. In Hamas\u2019s charter, it\u2019s almost identical in many, many ways. And here with the hypocrisy of South Africa, we will be there in the International Court of Justice, and will present proudly our case of using self defence under our most inherent right under international humanitarian law, where we are doing our utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground, to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties. We are alerting, we are calling, we are showing, we are sending leaflets, we are using all the means that international law enables us in order to move out people, so that we can unravel this huge city of terror underneath, in people's homes, living rooms and bedrooms, mosques and shops and schools. Yesterday we unravelled a huge factory of terror underneath a humanitarian corridor which Israel is employing in order to help the civilians of Gaza. \u201cI want to thank the United States of America, President Biden, and the administration, and you Secretary Blinken for your moral call of duty, for the fact that you're standing steadfast with Israel in this battle, which has to do clearly with humanity and with the values of the free world. Thank you very much.\u201d Secretary Blinken: \u201cThank you, Mr. President. As always, we greatly value the President's leadership in these incredibly challenging times for Israel, for countries in the region, and especially for people who continue to suffer. I've just come from a number of countries in the region, Turkey, Greece Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and I want to be able to share some of what I heard from those leaders with the President, as well as with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet later today. And of course, we'll have an opportunity to sit with the families of some of the hostages and discuss our relentless efforts to bring everyone home, back with their families. And there's lots to talk about in particular, about the way forward. So I look forward these conversations, as always, thank you very much.\u201d\u00a0",

FM Baerbock is visiting Israel for the fourth time since the outbreak of the war. FM Katz thanked for her support of Israel, her activities for the release of the abductees and her regional efforts to implement Security Council Resolution 1701 to distance Hezbollah from Israel\u2019s northern border. FM Katz raised the issue of the absurd charge of genocide filed by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and asked FM Baerbock for her support on this issue. FM Baerbock stated that she would work to help Israel spread the truth. FM Katz thanked FM Baerbock for the German government\u2019s actions against elements that encourage terrorism, including the outlawing of the Hamas terrorist organization.\u00a0 FM Katz: As a son of Holocaust survivors, it is particularly important to me that Germany supports us up and stands by our side in full support of our efforts. My commitment as foreign minister is to release all the abductees. I also told Foreign Minister Baerbock - Israel will not stop until everyone returns home.\"",
